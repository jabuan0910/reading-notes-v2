## What is growth mindset for me?

> **Growth Mindset** is the capability of taking something unlearned and igniting with relentless personal belief developed through one's own effort and perseverance. Hence, possessing the passion to learn infinitely.

## 3 things that keep me in check to maintaining a *growth mindset*.
1. Stay positive. Having a positive mental attitude is key to keeping one's own mental focus from drifting to something negative.
2. Create mental curiousity. Stacking up this trait helps to build momentum when directing your self to learning at full capacity.
3. Never give up. Think creatively to endure the pain of stumbling through roadblocks - ask questions; use resources to finding the answers.

Markdown
We learned how to use various syntax notations to Markdown in GitHub.
Used syntax for Markdown:
symbol # to create largest header
symbol ## to create second largest header; ###, ####, up to six hashtags at most.
symbol ** ** to bold a sentence or text
symbol * * to italicize a word or sentence
create ordered lists use 1., 2., 3., so on...
create bullet points (unordered lists) use * or - or + in front of line items.
code snippets
embed images..plus more...
Markdown is its own language. Used to communicate documentation. Primary language to communicate documentation to developers or to consumers of a library on what the application or website does.

See guide Basic writing and formatting syntax or Basic Syntax

Why Markdown?
HTML gives you significant control, but slows down authoring
Web sites often exist primarily as a way to publish content. A way for a developer to look at website to consume the information. Why? What? Where? Markdown as a language solves that problem for developers.
Its the process of writing the page. Its what the content is focused on.
What is Markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language for generating html files. A really good introductory to how to make documentation an how to build straight forward sites.
It's not a WYSIWYG editor like MS Word or Google Docs
Instead it uses textual symbols to indicate the structure of the page
For example:
This is a Heading --> ## This is a Heading
How do we Markdown?
GitHub uses Markdown pretty much everywhere:

Top level README.md files are auto-rendered
Any other .md files
Issues, comments, code reviews, etc...
GitHub Pages will convert your Markdown, apply a theme, and publish it!

Exact syntax is covered by many great guides (links in the assignment).

Go experiment with it, and see what you can learn!

Also, with GitHub. We learned how to create .md files on the site. Great for developers to collaborate!
