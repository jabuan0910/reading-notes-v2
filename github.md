Today we learned about Git and GitHub. I learned they are two different things. The major difference is that GitHub is mainly for code storage and whereas for Git is a version control system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set by recording changes. You can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. Therefore, by utilizing a version control system, mistakes with files can easily be rectified.

Some basic Git terminal commands include:

* git clone = clones the repository (these are really just a folder)
* git add . = adds all the files changed that are to be tracked by Git
* git commit = -m 'message here' - Commit changes
* git commit push origin main = Sends changes to GitHub
* git status = Lets you know the standing of modified files and whether they are staged to be committed or not, or  if there are commits needing to be pushed
* git stash = Allows you to temporarily hide changes that your not ready to commit
