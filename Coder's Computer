## Text Editors
### What is a text editor?
A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.

There are different text editors to choose from that vary based on developer's preference. Some examples below are:

* VS Code
* Notepad++
* Atom
* Sublime text

Call me biased, but the most favorite one I choose and like the most is VS Studio Code!
