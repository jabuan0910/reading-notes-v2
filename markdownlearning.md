# Markdown

## We learned how to use various syntax notations to Markdown in GitHub.

###### Used syntax for Markdown:

- symbol # to create largest header
- symbol ## to create second largest header; ###, ####, up to six hashtags at most.
- symbol ** ** to **bold** a sentence or text
- symbol * * to *italicize* a word or sentence
- create ordered lists use 1., 2., 3., so on...
- create bullet points (unordered lists) use * or - or + in front of line items.
- code snippets
- embed images..plus more...

Markdown is its own language. Used to communicate documentation. Primary language to communicate documentation to developers or to consumers of a library on what the application or website does.

See guide [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) or [Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

# Why Markdown?
- HTML gives you significant control, but slows down authoring
- Web sites often exist primarily as a way to publish **content**. A way for a developer to look at website to consume the information. Why? What? Where? Markdown as a language solves that problem for developers.
- Its the **process of writing** the page. Its what the content is focused on.

# What is Markdown?
* Markdown is a lightweight markup language for **generating** html files. A really good introductory to how to make documentation an how to build straight forward sites.
* It's **not** a WYSIWYG editor like MS Word or Google Docs
* Instead it uses textual symbols to indicate the structure of the page
* For example:

> #### This is a Heading    -->   ## This is a Heading

# How do we Markdown?
- GitHub uses Markdown pretty much everywhere:
    - Top level README.md files are auto-rendered
    - Any other .md files
    - Issues, comments, code reviews, etc...

- GitHub Pages will convert your Markdown, apply a theme, and publish it!
- Exact syntax is covered by many great guides (links in the assignment).
- Go experiment with it, and see what you can learn!


Also, with [GitHub](https://github.com/). We learned how to create .md files on the site. Great for developers to collaborate!
