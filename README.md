## What is growth mindset for me?

> **Growth Mindset** is the capability of taking something unlearned and igniting with relentless personal belief developed through one's own effort and perseverance. Hence, possessing the passion to learn infinitely.

## 3 things that keep me in check to maintaining a *growth mindset*.
1. Stay positive. Having a positive mental attitude is key to keeping one's own mental focus from drifting to something negative.
2. Create mental curiousity. Stacking up this trait helps to build momentum when directing your self to learning at full capacity.
3. Never give up. Think creatively to endure the pain of stumbling through roadblocks - ask questions; use resources to finding the answers.
