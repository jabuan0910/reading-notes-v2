## HTML - Wireframe and Design

### Day 4 - 9/29/22 - Code 102

We learned how to wireframe and use HTML to structure a website. 


## An introduction to wireframing

1. What is wireframing?
- Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. This process focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to process information on a site, based on the user research already performed by the UX design team.

- When designing for the screen you need to know where all the information is going to go in plain black and white diagrams before building anything with code—whether that’s a developer coding it, or you the designer. Wireframing is also a great way of getting to know how a user interacts with your interface, through the positioning of buttons and menus on the diagrams.

- Without the distractions of colors, typeface choices or text, wireframing lets you plan the layout and interaction of your interface. A commonly-used argument for wireframing is that if a user doesn’t know where to go on a plain hand-drawn diagram of your site page, then it is irrelevant what colors or fancy text eventually get used. A button or call to action needs to be clear to the user even it’s not brightly colored and flashing.

2. Wireframe examples
- Before you start designing the wireframes of your own app or product, take a look at some examples of wireframes. This will give you some inspiration for your own wireframes, as well as giving you an idea of the variety of ways of creating them. Some people like to draw their wireframes by hand, others feel more comfortable using software like Invision, or Balsamiq to create theirs. We’ll go through some of the tools you can use to create wireframes shortly, but it’s important to emphasize that how you make yours is up to you: some people feel more creative when sat at their computer, while others prefer to have a pen and paper in hand.

That said, for complete beginners, bear in mind the following when deciding on your wireframe creation process:
- Wireframes drawn with paper and a pencil, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change, which can help tremendously in early conversations about your website or product.
- With the help of paper-prototypes, you can test with end users at every stage of ideation and design. Changes at these stages are much easier—and therefore cheaper—than changes deemed necessary after coding is under way.
- Switching later to software (after initially hand-drawing your wireframe) allows you to keep track of more detailed decisions.

- It’s likely to be to your advantage to start off hand-drawing your wireframes before executing more detailed versions using an online app or software. The following wireframes should give you a good idea of how information can be organized on the screen.

# HTML

### HTML Basics
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.

### What is HTML? ##
HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.

Examples:
- `<p> </p>` - paragraph tags
- `<strong>` - provides emphasis
- `<img src='[image path]' alt='[image description]'>` - embeds image with description
- `<h1> </h1>` - headings numbered by priority, up to `<h6> </h6>`
- `<ul> </ul>` - unordered list
- `<ol> </ol>` - ordered list
- `<li>` - list items
- `<a href='[URL]'>[link text]</a>` - anchor tag with a hyperlink attribute

### Anatomy of HTML Document

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>[page title]</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="[image path]" alt="[image description]">
  </body>
</html>
```

# Semantics
In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)

Examples of Semantic elements:

```
<article>
<aside>
<details>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<header>
<main>
<mark>
<nav>
<section>
<summary>
<time>
```
