# The Coder's Computer

## Day 2 - 9/27/22

## Today we learned about terminal or command lines and various text editors.
## We also spent time in lab setting up our development environments on our terminal for **Commmand Line**. See the Computer Setup Guide [Here](https://codefellows.github.io/setup-guide/).

## Text Editors
### What is a text editor?
A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.

There are different text editors to choose from that vary based on developer's preference. Some examples below are:

* VS Code
* Notepad++
* Atom
* Sublime text

Call me biased, but my most favorite one is VS Studio Code! 

# Command Line

### What is it?

A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

Here are just few commands below we used to navigate around the terminal:

`cd` - Change Directory  
`ls` - List all items in the directory  
`pwd` - Present Working Directory  
`cd` .. - go back a level in the directory  
`touch file.html` - Create a new html file named "File.html"  
`mkdir myFolder` - Create a new folder named "My folder"  
`cp file.html ../myFolder` - copy the file myfile.html into the folder myFolder that is located one directory back  
`mv file.html ../myfolder` - move the file myFile.html into the folder myFolder that is located one directory back
